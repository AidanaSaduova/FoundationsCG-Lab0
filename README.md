First look at Computer graphics with WebGL  

## Task description  
The goal of this lab is to create a simple WebGL application. The focus is on setting up the Web GL pipeline and writing all the boilerplate code so that you can dive into the next lab without having to worry about Web GLs initialization.    
- Set up a drawing window and draw a simple box  
- Set up a basic WebGL program, which initializes the drawing window. Draw a simple triangle.
